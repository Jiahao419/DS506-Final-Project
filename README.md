## ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Prediction using US DOT & Weather Data  
**Boston University ‚Äì CS506: Data Science Tools & Applications**  

---

### üìò Project Overview
This project predicts **flight delays** using data from the **US Department of Transportation (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)** combined with **daily weather data** from **Meteostat**.

We aim to explore how operational (e.g., airlines, weekdays, routes) and environmental (e.g., temperature, precipitation, pressure) factors influence the likelihood of flight delays.  
The goal is to develop a robust, reproducible model that can estimate the probability of a flight delay based on both **flight-level** and **weather** features.

## üìä Preliminary Visualizations and Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Delay Rate by Month
![](outputs/plots/delay_rate_by_month.png)

- Shows seasonal variation in flight delays throughout 2020.  
- Delay rates tend to **increase during summer months (June‚ÄìAugust)** due to higher air traffic volume and weather disruptions.  
- A smaller spike appears in **December**, aligning with holiday travel peaks.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Delay Rate by Day of Week
![](outputs/plots/delay_rate_by_dow.png)

- Delay rates vary across weekdays.  
- **Fridays and Sundays** show higher delay frequencies, which makes sense since they correspond to business return trips and weekend leisure traffic.  
- **Tuesdays and Wednesdays** show the fewest delays.  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delay Rate by Airport
![](outputs/plots/delay_rate_by_airport.png)

- This visualization highlights **top airports with the highest delay rates**.  
- Major hub airports such as **ATL, ORD, and JFK** show more delays due to traffic congestion and operational complexity.  
- Smaller airports generally exhibit fewer delays.  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Departure vs Arrival Delay Correlation
![](outputs/plots/dep_vs_arr_delay.png)

- Displays a **strong linear correlation** between departure and arrival delays.  
- Late departures often cascade into late arrivals, suggesting systemic schedule propagation issues.  
- Correlation coefficient (Pearson) ‚âà **0.93**, confirming the dependency.  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ ROC Curves ‚Äì Baseline Models
![](outputs/plots/roc_curves.png)

- ROC curves compare initial models trained without weather data.  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieve moderate AUC (~0.55).  
- This baseline provides a reference for performance improvement once weather and feature engineering are added.  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ ROC Curves ‚Äì Weather-Enhanced Models
![](outputs/plots/roc_curves_weather.png)

- Models trained with weather variables show an **improvement in AUC from ~0.55 ‚Üí 0.58**.  
- Weather variables such as `temperature`, `wind speed`, and `pressure` contribute to better classification of delayed flights.  

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ ROC Curves ‚Äì All Combined Models
![](outputs/plots/roc_curves_weather_all.png)

- Combines baseline, weather-only, and feature-engineered models.  
- **Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HGB)** achieves the best AUC (~0.59).  
- Indicates that while delay prediction remains a difficult problem, added context improves performance modestly.  

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance (Random Forest ‚Äì Base Model)
![](outputs/plots/feature_importance_rf.png)

- The most predictive features in the base model include:  
  - **Route frequency** (flights per route)  
  - **Scheduled departure time** (temporal pattern)  
  - **Day of week**  
- Weather variables were not yet included here.  

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance (Random Forest ‚Äì With Weather)
![](outputs/plots/feature_importance_rf_weather.png)

- After integrating weather data, the top predictors include:  
  - **Route frequency**
  - **Origin-day flight volume**
  - **Temperature**
  - **Wind speed**
  - **Pressure**  
- Weather features rank just below operational ones, confirming their incremental predictive power.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed flights with missing or invalid delay data.  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., tail numbers, cancellation codes).  
   - Standardized column names and converted time fields to datetime format.  

2. **Weather Data Integration**
   - Downloaded daily weather observations from the **Meteostat API** for each airport.  
   - Merged weather features by airport and date.  
   - Missing values were imputed using median interpolation.  

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - `route_freq`: Number of flights per (origin, destination).  
   - `origin_day_volume`: Number of flights per origin airport per day.  
   - `is_weekend`: Boolean flag for weekend flights.  
   - `temp_mean`, `wind_mean`, and `pressure_mean`: from merged weather.  

4. **Normalization & Encoding**
   - Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**.  
   - Encoded categorical features (e.g., airlines, airports) using **OneHotEncoder**.

### Validation

| Random Forest          | + Weather + Engineered    |  0.784   |   0.237   | 0.082  |  0.122  | 0.560 |
| HistGradientBoosting   | + Weather + Engineered    | **0.814** |  0.257   | 0.010  |  0.019  | **0.591** |


**Interpretation:**
- Weather and engineered features improve recall significantly for Logistic Regression.  
- Histogram Gradient Boosting achieves the best AUC (0.59).  
- Route-level and weather-based predictors jointly improve overall detection sensitivity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Challenges and Limitations

Although the current pipeline successfully integrates flight and weather data and produces consistent results across models, several issues remain:

1. **Low AUC / Model Performance Ceiling**  
   - Even with additional weather and engineered features, the AUC only reaches about **0.59**.  
   - This indicates the models capture some but not all underlying delay factors ‚Äî suggesting that other variables (like air traffic control, carrier policies, or airport-level congestion) may be missing.

2. **Imbalanced Classes**  
   - Only around **18% of flights are delayed**, leading to bias toward the majority (non-delayed) class.  
   - Models tend to have high accuracy but low recall for delays.

3. **Temporal Dependency**  
   - Flight delays often depend on time sequences (e.g., previous flight delays causing propagation).  
   - Current models treat all rows independently, ignoring sequential or temporal correlations.

4. **Weather Feature Granularity**  
   - Daily-aggregated weather data may not fully represent real-time conditions at departure/arrival hours.  
   - Hourly weather data could potentially improve sensitivity.

5. **Operational Heterogeneity**  
   - Airlines and airports behave differently; model performance varies by region and carrier.  
   - Further stratified or per-airport modeling could improve robustness.

These challenges explain why the results, while consistent, still have limited predictive power (AUC < 0.6) and motivate further experimentation.

## üß† Next Steps
- Add **temporal validation** (train early months ‚Üí test later months).  
- Investigate **class imbalance** using SMOTE or reweighting.  
- Explore **XGBoost / LightGBM** models for better recall.  
- Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive predictions.
